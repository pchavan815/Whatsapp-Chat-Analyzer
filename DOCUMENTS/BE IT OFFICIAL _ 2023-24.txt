10/8/21, 08:06 - Swati Sinha HOD IT: Dear Madam/Sir,

Greetings from Indian Women Scientists' Association!

I am communicating on behalf of Indian Women Scientists' Association (IWSA),  a non-political, non-profit NGO with over 2500 members and 11 branches in different parts of the country. It has its headquarters at Vashi, Navi Mumbai. The main objectives of IWSA are to inculcate scientific temper in society through a variety of activities and also to empower girls and women by providing them various facilities to become socially and financially independent. Our activities are summed up on our website: www.iwsa.net.

To facilitate this objective, we have instituted a number of awards and scholarships to be distributed annually to deserving girl students pursuing Higher education in Science on MERIT-CUM-MEANS basis. This has been possible because of our supportive members and donors, who have contributed generously in the memory of their loved ones, kith and kin and teachers, whose names appear in the IWSA awards/scholarships.

The following is appended (These can be downloaded from the website too):
List of the IWSA Annual awards/scholarships for the year 2021-22, with eligibility criteria
Scholarship Application Form
I request you to give wide publicity to this announcement among your students. Due to COVID times, all programs are compelled to be online.

I hope that this announcement will get good visibility if you could put it up in your online announcement channels. 
We wish that deserving girl students should get a good opportunity to avail of these awards/scholarships.

The last date for applications to reach us by email/in person is on or before 15th October 2021.

Thanking you,
Yours sincerely,

Dr Nootan Bhakal.
Treasurer, IWSA HQ.
Convener,  Scholarship Committee, IWSA.

4/10/22, 16:51 - Swati Sinha HOD IT: Good Evening respected teachers and my dear friends, 
      This was to bring to the limelight that we are having Technical Mangalam on 15th and 16th April 2022. 
      In the following tech fest, we are having an event called the *Shark Tank Conclave*. The motto of this event is to give a platform for creative minds to pitch innovative technical ideas that could be applicable in real life. These ideas could be a part of one's mini-project, final year project, or even projects from any other competition
      As all of us are already working on such topics in Smart India Hackathon, let us all participate in this event and get some valuable suggestions from the sharks (judges) which will be helpful for the final presentation in SIH as well. Also, it is a humble request to circulate this information with other participants of events like Startathon and Manthan and also with students who have an interest in such domain
     I'm happy to promulgate that we have *Dr. Swati Sinha* and *Mr. Sanjay Jadhav* (Training and Placement Officer) as the Sharks for the event. 

Thanking you and Regards.
Adarsh G. Panicker

Hello everyone!

Greetings from Team Mimamsa 2023! Hope this mail finds you all in good spirits.
We, the students of *Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune* are extremely pleased to announce the *fifteenth edition of Mimamsa*. 

Mimamsa is a national level annual science challenge like no other - organised entirely by the students of IISER Pune.

*The philosophy of Mimamsa is apparent from its name which translates to "critical thinking, inquiry and in-depth analysis."* The goal of this challenge is to test and develop an understanding of science rather than scientific information. Mimamsa prioritises discussion and investigation over right or wrong answers.

Mimamsa is held in a two-stage format - 
*College students who are in the first three years of an undergraduate education programme get to form a team of 3 or 4 participants* and compete in the first stage, dubbed the *'Prelims'*, to be *held online, in January*. The Top 4 teams across the country would then compete in the second and final stage *'Mains'*, which will be held on IISER-Pune campus (travel and accommodation costs completely paid for) and is scheduled to be *held in April*.

Mimamsa 2023 Prelims is scheduled to be held on 29th of January (Sunday) 2023 from 10 AM to 12 AM (times are subject to change). It will be an online test of both objective and subjective questions comprising 5 sections - Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology, and Earth and Climate Sciences (ECS).
Registrations are now open. There is no exam fee. The last date for registration is 22nd January, 2023. There's no limit to the number of teams that can participate from a particular college.

There are *prizes worth INR 4 lakhs* along with loads of prizes for zonal and subject toppers. Add to this the honour of representing one's college at a renowned national level science challenge.

For registration, please visit http://mimamsa.iiserpune.ac.in. Further information can be found on the same. In case of any queries, please feel free to write to us at mimamsa@sac.iiserpune.ac.in, or contact the members of the organising committee, whose contact details are given below. You can also ask us questions on our Quora Page:  https://www.quora.com/profile/Mimamsa-IISER-Pune-1

We assure you that this year's Mimamsa will be more fun, more exciting, will have more prizes and more in-depth critical analysis questions waiting for you.

Also, please do forward this to your friends who might be interested in participating!

4/6/23, 17:16 - Sayali KY MGMCET IT: Hello Everyone,

We are planning to start Techno-Social Club from our IT Department very soon. 

Motivation - 

In the fast and hard day to day life we are busy enough. But at the end when we sit and think , we can imagine that whatever we are doing it‚Äôs only for ourselves, to prove ourselves superior, to get a promotion, to score more than someone etc etc. In this, we are forgetting ‚Äò‚ÄôWE‚Äô‚Äô I.e our Society.
The society where we stay, directly or indirectly plays an important role in our progress. It's our moral responsibility to contribute for the betterment of society. 
This is our initiative to give something valuable to our society by implementing the knowledge and lessons of engineering life.

Vision - To transform our society by building conscious and capable citizens by implementing our technical skills.

Mission - To work for the betterment of the society by engaging ourselves through various projects and activities.

4/6/23, 17:16 - Sayali KY MGMCET IT: Hello Everyone,

We are planning to open Bloggers Club from our IT Department very soon.

*Motivation*- 

As we know our generation spends most of the time on social media. Reading , writing skills enhancements are also necessary, it boosts the brain and it's our traditional approach to learn new things. In this tech-oriented world, most of us like to read valuable content on the internet, but unfortunately most of the sites fail to do so.  Here is the solution with which we are providing a platform to individuals to share their knowledge and experiences of the different fields which will provide valuable content to our readers also. Blogs related to travel, food, technology, arts etc. users can post and read on our platform.

*Vision:*
To give big opinion platform on national and international level for personal expression, allowing students, faculty to share their thoughts, experiences, and perspectives with the world in a very decent way.
(It is apolotical - No political discussions are allowed)

*Mission:*
To enhance the hidden writing talent in any language according to the interest of an individual.

We are expecting responses from all of you.

Those who are willingly ready to be a part of this club, please fill the formüëáüèª

Hope that you're enjoying ongoing sports activities in college. 

Today, it is observed that some of the students are not showing sportive spirit and unnecessarily creating hurdles in conducting sports. 

Henceforth, if it is observed that one of the team or their supporters are not obeying the instructions or unnecessarily creating the trouble then that team will be disqualified, and if it continues further and observed that students of one of the department are continuously creating problems then that department will be disqualified for further sports events and no certificates/medals/trophy will be issued to them.
